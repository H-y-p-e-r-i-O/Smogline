> **"The boundaries between the 11 dimensions have crumbled. The Necrosis is not just caves down below. It is a parasitic reality, waiting for the Membrane to crack."**

**Smogline** is a hardcore technical mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 set in a "Scientific Post-Apocalypse". We combine real physics (String Theory) with organic horror.

## 🚧 Release Status: Upcoming

> [!NOTE]
> **The mod is currently in private Pre-Alpha.**
> We prioritize code quality and optimization. The public release on **CurseForge** and **Modrinth** will only occur upon reaching the **Beta** stage.

## 🌌 The Lore & Setting

You are a bio-modified subject, awakened from cryostasis after the catastrophe.
* **The Catastrophe:** An attempt to unfold curled dimensions led to the "String Collapse".
* **The Surface:** Radioactive wastelands, ruins, and mutated fauna.
* **The Membrane:** A layer of super-dense matter that replaced Bedrock. A barrier separating our world from the abyss.
* **The Necrosis (Dimension):** A living, chaotic dimension "on the other side". To get there, the player must **breach the bottom of the world**.

## ⚙️ Development Log (Implemented Features)

Work on the mod's core is in full swing:

### 1. 🌍 Tectonic-like World Generation
A complete overhaul of the vanilla terrain generator using *Tectonic* algorithms.
* **Exclusive Biomes:** Unique zones with varying degrees of pollution, each containing unique resources.
* **Atmosphere:** Custom fog, sky color, surface blocks, and wasteland post-effects.

### 2. 🌀 Breach to Necrosis (New Dimension)
* **The Membrane:** As a result of the String Collapse, all bedrock was replaced by the Membrane, which, unlike bedrock, is not indestructible. Technology allows you to create a breach in reality.
* **The Transition:** Destroying the Membrane opens a path to fall directly into the Necrosis dimension (Work in Progress).

### 3. 🎯 New Arsenal
Next-generation base defense:
* **Turrets:** Added the first firearm turret, which shoots various projectile types with ballistic trajectory, features advanced AI, and smart target locking.
* **Grenades:** Several types are already present, including nuclear grenades.
* **Mines:** From anti-personnel to micro-nuclear charges.
* **Firearms (WIP):** Implemented a starter rifle that fires 20mm turret shells. Serves as a prototype for future firearms implementation.

### 4. 🔩 Kinetic Energy
* **Shafts & Gearboxes:** Visually accurate torque transmission.
* **Clutch:** Allows interrupting torque transmission to subsequent elements.
* **Gears & Belts (WIP):** Increase, decrease, and change torque direction using gears of different diameters. Transfer torque to parallel shafts via chain or belt drives.

### 5. ⚡ Energy Grid
* **System limits are not the limit!:** A fully custom energy system written from scratch that supports massive energy values, up to 9.2 quintillion!
* **Forge Energy Compatibility:** Our energy is fully compatible with native Forge Energy (FE), which is the basis for most tech mods like Mekanism. Use energy converters to link two different systems.
* **Advanced Energy Control:** Storage modes, priority systems, breakers, diodes (WIP) — everything for the most complex and branching energy grids.

## 🔮 Roadmap to Beta

* [ ] Complete game progression up to the early mid-game stage.
* [ ] Stable versions of "Necrosis" dimension biomes and Membrane breaching mechanics.
* [ ] Refinement of electric and kinetic systems, perfecting their interaction.
* [ ] Addition of the initial arsenal: (firearms, melee weapons, mines, bombs, grenades, and charges).
* [ ] Increasing the number of turrets and ammunition types.
* [ ] Increasing the variety of Overworld biomes and their refinement. Mechanics for generating abandoned cities are also planned.
* [ ] Adding anomalous entities escaping from beneath the Membrane.
* [ ] Introduction of the radiation system and player contamination.
* [ ] Adding armor and armor modifications.
